# uw3_install_guide

Instructions for a bare-metal installation of Underworld3.

**Note**: After successfully installing dependencies using the `uw3_gadi_install_hdf5fromgadi.sh` script, some issues may arise when running pytest. Specifically, certain tests might fail due to insufficient access permissions to the `/tmp/...` directory on Gadi.
